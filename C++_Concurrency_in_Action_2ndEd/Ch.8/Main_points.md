## Dividing work
- Divide by data
- Divide by task type (separating concerns)

# When separating concerns, be careful:
- Do not separate the wrong concerns, as it could result in too much communication
- Over specialize the concerns

## When designing data structure layout, keep in mind:
- Contention
- False sharing
- Data proximity
- Exception safety
- Scalability of data/users/hardware
